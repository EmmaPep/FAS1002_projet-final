	abstract = {This new edition to the classic book by ggplot2 creator Hadley Wickham highlights compatibility with knitr and RStudio. ggplot2 is a data visualization package for R that helps users create data graphics, including those that are multi-layered, with ease. With ggplot2, it's easy to: - produce handsome, publication-quality plots with automatic legends created from the plot specification - superimpose multiple layers (points, lines, maps, tiles, box plots) from different data sources with automatically adjusted common scales - add customizable smoothers that use powerful modeling capabilities of R, such as loess, linear models, generalized additive models, and robust regression - save any ggplot2 plot (or part thereof) for later modification or reuse - create custom themes that capture in-house or journal style requirements and that can easily be applied to multiple plots - approach a graph from a visual perspective, thinking about how each component of the data is represented on the final plot This book will be useful to everyone who has struggled with displaying data in an informative and attractive way. Some basic knowledge of R is necessary (e.g., importing data into R). ggplot2 is a mini-language specifically tailored for producing graphics, and you'll learn everything you need in the book. After reading this book you'll be able to produce graphics customized precisely for your problems, and you'll find it easy to get graphics out of your head and on to the screen or page. New to this edition:{\textless} - Brings the book up-to-date with ggplot2 1.0, including major updates to the theme system - New scales, stats and geoms added throughout - Additional practice exercises - A revised introduction that focuses on ggplot() instead of qplot() - Updated chapters on data and modeling using tidyr, dplyr and broom},

	abstract = {The development of COVID-19 vaccines is occurring at a rapid pace, with the potential for a vaccine to be available within 6 months. So who should be prioritized for vaccination when in the first instance, there will be insufficient supply to meet demand? There is no doubt that health-care workers in all settings should be vaccinated first, but who comes next will be a complex decision based on local epidemiology, societal values, and the ability of the vaccines to prevent both severe disease and to reduce transmission thereby eliciting herd protection. The decision on who to vaccinate should be equitable, highly contextualized, and based on the property of each vaccine. In some settings, the elderly may be prioritized, in others, it may be the population most likely to get infected and responsible for community spread. To support decision-making on who to be prioritized for vaccination requires urgent additional research on the epidemiology of COVID-19; preexisting immunity and who is responsible for transmission in a variety of settings; the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in children and pregnant women; and determining whether COVID-19 vaccines prevent asymptomatic infection and transmission.},
